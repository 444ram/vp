Task 5:Working with Assemblies 

1.Demonstrate a console application by creating a Private Assembly and use it in different applications.


2.Demonstrate how to Create a Public assembly and store it in GAC and use it in all applications.


1.Demonstrate a console application by creating a Private Assembly and use it in different applications.

Step 1: Create a Private Assembly (Class Library)
1.Open Visual Studio and create a new Class Library project.
2.Name it MyMathLibrary.
3.Replace the default Class1.cs with the following code and build the solution


namespace MyMathLibrary
{
    public class MathOperations
    {
        public int Add(int a, int b)
        {
            return a + b;
        }

        public int Subtract(int a, int b)
        {
            return a - b;
        }

        public int Multiply(int a, int b)
        {
            return a * b;
        }

        public double Divide(int a, int b)
        {
            return (double)a / b;
        }
    }
}


Step 2: 
Create a Console Application to Use the Private Assembly
1.Create a new Console Application project named MathApp.
2.go to solution explorer and Right-click on References in the MathApp project and select Add Reference.
3.Browse to the location of MyMathLibrary.dll and add it as a reference.
4.In the Program.cs file, write the following code:

using System;
using MyMathLibrary; // Reference the private assembly

namespace MathApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
MathOperations mathOps = new MathOperations();

            int sum = mathOps.Add(10, 20);
            int difference = mathOps.Subtract(30, 15);
            int product = mathOps.Multiply(5, 6);
            double quotient = mathOps.Divide(40, 8);

Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);
Console.WriteLine("Difference: " + difference);
Console.WriteLine("Product: " + product);
Console.WriteLine("Quotient: " + quotient);

Console.ReadLine(); // Wait for user input before closing the console
        }
    }
}
